# Dungeons and Dragons 5e Character Creator

A pretty basic character creator for D&D 5e.  This is a ground-up rewrite of the java version I had been working on because I don't like the way Java handles includes.  Uses a command line interface, I'd like to implement a GUI eventually.

### Implemented

* Basic info (Name, level)
* Race
* Class
* Background (Partial, selection and proficiencies)
* Skills and proficiencies

### To be implemented

* Race, class, background features
* Levelling
* Hit points, saving throws
* Spells

### Maybe eventually

* Retrofit the creator for earlier editions
* Inventory system
* Import/Export functionality
* GUI
