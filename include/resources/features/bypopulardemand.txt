You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a nobleâ€™s court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.
